     * should be maintained as part of en_lflow's data.  However, it would
     * be less efficient and more complex:
     *
     * 1. It would require an extra search (using the index) to find the
     * lflows.
     *
     * 2. Building the index needs to be thread-safe, using either a global
     * lock which is obviously less efficient, or hash-based lock array which
     * is more complex.
     *
     * Adding the lflow_ref here is more straightforward. The drawback is that
     * we need to keep in mind that this data belongs to en_lflow node, so
     * never access it from any other nodes.
     *
     * Note: lflow_ref is not thread safe.  Only one thread should
     * access ls_arp_record->lflow_ref at any given time.
